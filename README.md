# hello-world
Just another repository
To put it simply, I excel at critical thinking and solving complex problems in an agile environment. Formally, I am a High-Impact Technology Product, Marketing, Pricing & Analytics Management leader who has launched and marketed high-value, complex, large feature-set application suites, data products and professional services in Cloud IaaS/PaaS/SaaS, Big Data, Advanced BI/Analytics, Mobile Data, and E-Commerce/Digital Marketing platforms. Most of my launches have been seminal New Product Introductions (NPIs) with some exciting add-on launches for active Installed Bases.
Having worked in both Fortune 500 companies and high-value product start-ups, I bring a passion for NPI launches backed by comprehensive business case development & leadership buy-in, large-sample user & market research prioritized features and platform design, creative MVP prototyping, agile cross-functional collaboration, end-to-end launch plans ownership, optimal RoI technology stack selection, sustainable high-growth GTM and pricing models, and analytics supported marketing collateral development.
I continuously learn about latest product management, marketing, cloud/mobile/data IaaS/PaaS/SaaS orchestrations and data science techniques. I am certified in Udemy's AWS and Azure Foundations, Stanford University's AI/ML via Octave Programming, Carnegie Mellon University's Statistical Analysis via R Programming, SiriusDecisions’ Product Marketing pathways, and McKinsey Academy’s McKinsey Management Program - Problem Solving Course.
I actively write blogs and post original thoughts (some have thousands of views) on LinkedIn, Twitter, Slack etc. My LinkedIn profile showcases 2 dozen+ Actual Work Deliverables, my e-books, blog, continuing education credentials, strong references and recommendations that attest to my all-round product management and marketing credentials.
